Implement it in Python below and see how it compares in sorting our short and long lists. You should be able to easily find guides on how to implement any of the algorithms. Can you figure out why it runs faster or slower than our other sorting algorithms?"

    "The selection sort algorithm performs fairly slowly. This algorithm works by going through the elements and finding the minimum, placing that element at the beginning of the set, and then repeating this process with the remaining elements. The reason that this algorithm is relatively slow is that it has to go through all of the remaining elements at each step in the process; however, it does perform relatively few swaps if that is important."
