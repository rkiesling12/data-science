    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be analyzing data from Rent the Runway. Rent the Runway is a clothing rental service that allows women to rent designer items at a fraction of their cost. Rent the Runway provides two types of plans: Rent the Runway Reserve, which allows women to rent items for a one-time special occastion, and Rent the Runway Unlimited, which allows women to rent unlimited pieces on rotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes information from 192,544 reviews of items on Rent the Runway. It includes information on the customer's age, body type, bust size, height, and weight. Information about the category of item, the size of item rented, and what purpose the item was rented for are included as well. Finally, customer feedback about the item is included. There is information on the customer rating, customer review summary and full text, feedback on whether the item fit/was too small/was too large, and the date that the customer reviewed the item. \n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing this data, we will assume that customers who have reviewed items are representative of RTR customers as a whole."

    "One of the biggest issues when renting or purchasing clothing is determinining the correct size that you need. As shown above, items that did not fit receieved lower ratings than those that did. Further analysis of this data set could be used to help improve the size recommendation process. By using the available information about customer height, weight, and body type, RTR could predict whether certain items will fit the customer correctly. Additionally, by analyzing the feedback from the customer reviews, RTR can gain insight into why certain items did not fit the customer correctly and use that information to help refine their recommendation system."
