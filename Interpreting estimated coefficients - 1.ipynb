    "This model gives the coefficients of the model, but it does not give their significance. These are necessary to know whether the coefficients are meaningful and should be included in the model. Based on the model above, families spend a base of 873 dollars annually. An increase in annual income of 1 dollar leads to a 0.00012 dollar increase in spending plus a 0.00002 dollar increase times income squared. Having children decreases spending by 223.57 dollars annually."
