Read this nontechnical blog post of Netflix about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model.\n",

It also incorporates information about the titles themselves, such as their genre, actors, and release year. Finally, it incorporates information about the time of day that you watch, the devices you watch on, and how long you watch. They could also incorporate factors such as whether the movie has won any awards or information on the location where you watch."
