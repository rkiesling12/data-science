When looking at similar words, most of the words entered came up with similar words, but when I entered U.S.A, it returned a set of terms such as \"trademark lawsuit\" that might come after U.S.A. For other countries, this does not seem to happen and either similar countries or cities in that country generally come up. For analogies, this generally worked best when they were straightforward; something like Boston is to Massachusetts as Austin is to blank worked better than dress is to woman as suit is to blank, which returned lawsuit, which is not what we would expect. For words that don't match, putting in a fourth word that was more similar to the other three caused incorrect results, such as 'ice water juice steam', which I expected to return juice, but returned ice."
